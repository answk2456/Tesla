<h2>What is Tesla?</h2>
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc." target="_blank" title="tesla-wikipedia">Tesla</a></strong>,Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors, Inc.) is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California.

<p>Tesla's current products include <u>electric cars</u> (the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y), battery energy storage from home to grid scale (the Powerwall, Powerpack, and Megapack), solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services.
<br>Founded in July 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company’s name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla.</p>

<p>Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software and the proprietary motor". The next three employees at Tesla were Ian Wright, Elon Musk, and J. B. Straubel.
<br>Musk, who has served as CEO since 2008, said in 2006 that "the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors...is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy toward a solar electric economy" and it would build a wide range of electric vehicles, including "affordably priced family cars", and co-market SolarCity solar panels to do so.
<br>Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016.</p>
